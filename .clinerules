    "name": "SHMUP Your Friends",
    "description": "A vertical-scrolling shoot-'em-up (SHMUP) game made with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core concept is that the bosses are based on the creator's friends. The game is designed to be fun, retro-style, and eventually deployed on the web.",
    "goals": [
      "Create fun, distinct boss battles.",
      "Implement new gameplay features like power-ups and different enemy types.",
      "Keep the code clean, well-commented, and easy to understand.",
      "Maintain a retro pixel-art aesthetic and sound design."

Assume I have a good understanding of web fundamentals but may need guidance on game-specific logic and the Web Audio API."

  "rules": {
    "general": [
      "All game logic must be written in vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). Do not use external game frameworks like Phaser or Three.js unless explicitly requested.",
      "All styling should be done in the `<style>` tag within the HTML file. Do not suggest external CSS files.",
      "Prioritize readability and maintainability. Add comments to explain complex logic, especially for game loops, collision detection, and boss patterns.",
      "When adding new features, integrate them smoothly into the existing code structure.",
      "Ensure all code is self-contained within the `index.html` and `js/game.js` files as per the project structure."
    ],
    "sound": "All sound effects should be generated procedurally using the Web Audio API. Avoid using external sound files for SFX to keep the project lightweight and demonstrate API capabilities."
